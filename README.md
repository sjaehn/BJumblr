## Installation

a) Install the bjumblr package for your system
* [Arch user repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/bjumblr.lv2-git) by Milkii Brewster
* [FreeBSD](https://www.freshports.org/audio/bjumblr-lv2) by yurivict
* [NixOS](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/release-20.09/pkgs/applications/audio/bjumblr/default.nix) by Bart Brouns
* [openSUSE](https://software.opensuse.org/package/BJumblr)
* Check https://repology.org/project/bjumblr/versions for other systems

b) Build your own binaries in the following three steps.

Step 1: Clone or download this repository.

Step 2: Install pkg-config and the development packages for x11, cairo, soundfile, and lv2 if not done yet. If you
don't have already got the build tools (compilers, make, libraries) then install them too.

On Debian-based systems you may run:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libx11-dev libcairo2-dev libsndfile-dev lv2-dev
```

On Arch-based systems you may run:
```
sudo pacman -S base-devel
sudo pacman -S pkg-config libx11 cairo libsndfile lv2
```

Step 3: Building and installing into the default lv2 directory (/usr/local/lib/lv2/) is easy using `make` and
`make install`. Simply call:
```
make
sudo make install
```

**Optional:** Standard `make` and `make install` parameters are supported. Compiling using `make CPPFLAGS+=-O3`
is recommended to improve the plugin performance. Alternatively, you may build a debugging version using
`make CPPFLAGS+=-g`. For installation into an alternative directory (e.g., /usr/lib/lv2/), change the
variable `PREFIX` while installing: `sudo make install PREFIX=/usr`. If you want to freely choose the
install target directory, change the variable `LV2DIR` (e.g., `make install LV2DIR=~/.lv2`) or even define
`DESTDIR`.

**Optional:** Further supported parameters include `LANGUAGE` (usually two letters code) to change the GUI
language (see customize).

## Running

After the installation Carla, Ardour and any other LV2 host should automatically detect B.Jumblr.

If jalv is installed, you can also call it
```
jalv.gtk https://www.jahnichen.de/plugins/lv2/BJumblr
```
to run it stand-alone and connect it to the JACK system.

**Jack transport is required to get information about beat and bar position (not required for seconds mode)**

**The host must provide information about beat and bar position to use B.Jumblr in these modes.**
**Pure audio tracks (Ardour) may lack these information. Try to add a MIDI input!**


## Usage

B.Jumblr is neither a sample slicer nor a step sequencer. From the technical POV B.Jumblr is a
sequencer pattern-controlled audio delay effect.

The pattern defines at when (default: vertical) and which (default: horizontal) piece of the audio
input stream is sent to the audio output. Use the default diagonal line (zero delay line) pattern
for live playback. Moving a pad one step to the right results in a one step delayed playback of the
respective piece of the audio input stream. Each pad (and thus each piece) can be leveled up or
down by mouse wheel scrolling.

In addition, the user can control the playback progression using the playback buttons or the speed
dial. This is facilitated via the progression delay.


### Source

Select between (live) audio stream or a sample file as source. In the sample mode you can select an
audio file (supported formats include wav, aiff, au, sd2, flac, caf, ogg, and mp3) and the range of
the audio file to be used. Set the start and the end point of the playback range by dragging the
respective vertical yellow line. You can also zoom in and out by resizing the horizontal scroll bar.
The playback of the selected range now always starts with the first step in the sequencer.

You can also choose if the sample is played as a loop or not. But this will only be relevant if the
selected range is shorter than the sequencer loop.


### Pattern page tabs

Define multiple patterns. Click on a tab to highlight the tab and to edit the respective pattern.
Press â–¸ on the tab to switch playback to the respective pattern. Press the piano keys symbol to
enable / disable MIDI-controlled playback of the respective pattern.

| Symbol | Description |
| --- | --- |
| + | Add a pattern page after the respective page. |
| - | Remove this pattern page. |
| < | Move pattern page backward. |
| > | Move pattern page forward. |


### MIDI control page

This menu appears upon clicking on the piano keys symbol in the respective tab. Enable / disable
MIDI-controlled playback of the respective pattern by selection or deselection (= none) of a MIDI
status. You can manually set the parameters to which B.Jumblr shall respond or you can use MIDI
learning. Don't forget to confirm ("OK") or discard changes ("Cancel")!


### Pattern matrix

* **Left click**: Set (or delete) pad level
* **Right click**: Pick pad level
* **Scroll**: Increase or decrease pad value
* **Shift scroll**: Resize waveform

You may change the orientation of the pattern matrix from vertical progression (default) to
horizontal progression by clicking on the flip symbol on the top right of the pattern.


### Calibration

B.Jumblr time line automatically synchronizes with the host time/position. Use the button - and +
to manually shift the whole sample /stream. The button < sets the current sample to the start of
the pattern. The home button can be used to re-synchronize with the host.


### Step edit mode

There are two edit modes. The **ADD** mode allows to place additional pads to a step (row) or to remove
them. So you can also set more than one pad per column to produce echo effects or make a canon.

In contrast, there is only (exactly) one pad per step allowed in the **REPLACE** mode. Clicking or
dragging will result in a replacement of the original pad. Note: Deletion of pads (cut) in the
REPLACE mode results in their replacement by default pads.


### Step size

Defines the duration of each step. You can select between 1/16 and 4 seconds or beats or bars.
Alternatively, you can enter any value between 0.01 and 4.0 in a host provided generic GUI.
Note: Jack transport is required in the beats mode and in the bars mode.


### Pattern size

Defines the total pattern size (= number of steps, = number of columns). You can choose between
predefined pattern sizes from 2 to 32 steps. Alternatively, you can enter any value between 2 and 32
in a host provided generic GUI.


### Playback and speed

Controls the progression of the pattern. These buttons do not shift the sample /stream (in contrast to
calibration). The white buttons modify the position (reset, increase, difference to start of the step,
or increase) of the pattern progression represented by the yellow markers left and right to the pattern.
The speed dial controls the speed of progression. These kinds of manipulation of the pattern progression
are facilitated via the progression delay. The total amount of the progression delay (= delay buttons +
speed-induced delay) is displayed in the panel above the buttons.


## Customize

You can create customized builds of B.Jumblr using the parameter `LANGUAGE` (e.g., `make LANGUAGE=DE`).
To create a new language pack, copy `src/Locale_EN.hpp` and edit the text for the respective definitions.
But do not change or delete any definition symbol!
